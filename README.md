# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 

## Lectures by [DataTalks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJjEePXIdE-LVUx_1ZZjYGW)

This course is intended to teach data engineering practices and its techniques.

Since I'm attending the lectures and taking notes at the same time they might be kinda messy and hard to understand. I plan to enhance them at the end of the course.

Hope you find it useful!

I am not uploading terraform files before I inspect them thoroughly and make sure they are safe to share :)
